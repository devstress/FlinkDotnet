# Welcome to Flink.NET

## Overview of Flink.NET

Flink.NET is a comprehensive Apache Flink integration solution that enables .NET developers to build and submit streaming jobs to Apache Flink clusters using a fluent C# DSL. It provides a bridge between the .NET ecosystem and Apache Flink's powerful distributed stream processing capabilities.

*(See main [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) for more details)*

## Key Features & Goals

*   **Fluent C# DSL:** Write streaming job definitions using an intuitive, type-safe C# API
*   **Apache Flink Integration:** Submit jobs to existing Apache Flink clusters without running JVM code locally
*   **JSON Intermediate Representation:** Clean separation between .NET job definition and Flink execution
*   **Kubernetes Ready:** Complete deployment manifests for production Apache Flink clusters
*   **REST API Gateway:** .NET ASP.NET Core Web API that translates .NET job definitions to Flink DataStream jobs

*(See main [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) for more details)*

## Architecture Overview

Flink.NET provides an integration architecture that connects .NET applications with Apache Flink:

*   **Integration Philosophy:** Flink.NET acts as a bridge to Apache Flink clusters rather than reimplementing stream processing in .NET
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **.NET SDK (Flink.JobBuilder):** Provides fluent C# API for job definition
    *   **Job Gateway (.NET ASP.NET Core):** Translates job definitions to Apache Flink DataStream API
    *   **Apache Flink Cluster:** Handles actual stream processing execution

## Use Cases

Flink.NET with Apache Flink integration can be used for a variety of stream processing applications, including:

*   Real-time data analytics with Apache Flink's high-throughput processing
*   Event-driven microservices integration with Kafka sources and sinks
*   Complex event processing using Flink's windowing and state management
*   Data ingestion and transformation pipelines with exactly-once semantics
*   Anomaly detection using Flink's CEP (Complex Event Processing) capabilities

## Flink.Net Best Practices

For production-ready applications, follow our comprehensive best practices guides:

* **[[Complete Usage Example|Complete-Usage-Example]]** - Step-by-step example with connection strings and backend configuration
* **[[Flink.Net Best Practices: Stream Processing Patterns|Flink.Net-Best-Practices-Stream-Processing-Patterns]]** - Complete guide to Flink.Net standard pipeline patterns
* **[[Flink.Net Back Pressure|FLINK_NET_BACK_PRESSURE]]** - Credit-based flow control and back pressure handling
* **[[RocksDB State Backend|Core-Concepts-RocksDB-State-Backend]]** - Production-grade state management

## Quality Assurance & Testing

Our comprehensive testing infrastructure ensures high quality standards:

* **[[Stress Tests Overview|Stress-Tests-Overview]]** - High-performance load testing with Apache Flink 2.0 compliance
* **[[Reliability Tests Overview|Reliability-Tests-Overview]]** - Fault tolerance and recovery testing for reliable operation

### Recommended Pipeline Pattern

Follow the Flink.Net standard pattern for optimal performance:

```
Source -> Map/Filter -> KeyBy -> Process/Window -> AsyncFunction -> Sink
```

This pattern provides:
- Superior performance and scalability
- Built-in fault tolerance and exactly-once semantics  
- Rich monitoring and observability
- Industry-standard patterns and maintainability
