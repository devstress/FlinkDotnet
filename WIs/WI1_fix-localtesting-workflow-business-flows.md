**Created**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Implementation

## Lessons Applied from Previous WIs
### Previous WI References
- No previous WIs found for this specific issue
### Lessons Applied  
- Will ensure thorough debugging before proposing solutions
- Will implement business flow testing rather than just container validation
### Problems Prevented
- Avoiding incomplete workflow testing that doesn't validate actual functionality

## Phase 1: Investigation
### Requirements
- Fix OTel collector container startup failure
- Implement LocalTesting API business flow testing
- Ensure all containers start successfully
- Add Complex Logic Stress Test execution to workflow

### Debug Information (MANDATORY - Update this section for every investigation)
- **Error Messages**: 
  ```
  otel-collector container failure:
  'service.telemetry.metrics' decoding failed due to the following error(s):
  '' has invalid keys: address
  ```
- **Log Locations**: GitHub Actions workflow logs showing container startup failures
- **System State**: LocalTesting workflow runs container validation but no business flow testing
- **Reproduction Steps**: 
  1. LocalTesting workflow starts Aspire environment
  2. OTel collector fails with configuration error
  3. Workflow validates container accessibility but doesn't test business flows
- **Evidence**: 
  - OTel config error in service.telemetry.metrics section
  - LocalTesting API has comprehensive endpoints for business flow testing
  - Complex Logic Stress Test documentation shows expected business flows

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **OTel Configuration Issue**: The `otel-config.yaml` has incorrect `service.telemetry.metrics.address` configuration
2. **Missing Business Flow Testing**: Workflow only validates container startup, doesn't execute any business logic
3. **Incomplete Validation**: Need to test actual LocalTesting API endpoints and Complex Logic Stress Test flows

### Solution Design
1. **Fix OTel Configuration**: Remove invalid `address` key from `service.telemetry.metrics` section
2. **Implement Business Flow Testing**: Add step-by-step testing of LocalTesting API endpoints
3. **Add Complex Logic Stress Test**: Execute actual business flows using the API endpoints

## Phase 2: Design  
### Architecture Decisions
- Fix OTel collector configuration by removing invalid keys
- Add business flow testing step to workflow after container validation
- Use PowerShell to call LocalTesting API endpoints for comprehensive testing

### Why This Approach
- Fixes immediate container startup issue
- Adds real business value testing instead of just infrastructure validation
- Uses existing LocalTesting API that's designed for this purpose

### Alternatives Considered
- Could use separate workflow for business testing, but better to have comprehensive validation in one workflow
- Could skip OTel collector but it's important for observability

## Phase 3: Implementation
### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed OTel Collector Configuration
**File**: `LocalTesting/LocalTesting.AppHost/otel-config.yaml`
- **Problem**: Invalid `address: 0.0.0.0:8888` key in `service.telemetry.metrics` section
- **Solution**: Replaced with `level: detailed` which is the correct configuration
- **Result**: OTel collector should now start without configuration errors

#### 2. Added Comprehensive Business Flow Testing
**File**: `.github/workflows/local-testing.yml`
- **Added**: New step "Execute Complex Logic Stress Test Business Flows"
- **Functionality**: Tests all 7 steps of the Complex Logic Stress Test API:
  1. Environment Setup - validates Aspire services health
  2. Security Token Configuration - configures token renewal (1000 msg interval for CI)
  3. Backpressure Configuration - sets up lag-based rate limiting  
  4. Message Production - produces 10K messages with correlation IDs
  5. Flink Job Management - starts streaming job with complex logic pipeline
  6. Batch Processing - processes messages in batches of 100
  7. Message Verification - verifies correlation ID matching and success rates

#### 3. Enhanced Workflow Validation
- **Before**: Only checked container startup and API accessibility
- **After**: Full business flow execution with comprehensive error handling
- **Validation**: Tests both infrastructure AND actual business functionality
- **Reporting**: Detailed success/failure reporting for each step

### Implementation Details
```powershell
# Example of business flow testing added to workflow:
$apiBase = "http://localhost:5000/api/ComplexLogicStressTest"

# Step 1: Setup Environment
$setupResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$apiBase/step1/setup-environment" -Method POST

# Step 4: Produce Messages (10K for CI speed)
$messageConfig = @{
  TestId = "ci-test-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddHHmmss')"
  MessageCount = 10000
}
$productionResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$apiBase/step4/produce-messages" -Method POST -Body ($messageConfig | ConvertTo-Json)

# ... continues for all 7 steps
```

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
### Build Verification
- ✅ LocalTesting solution builds successfully with changes
- ✅ OTel configuration syntax is valid
- ✅ Workflow YAML syntax is correct
- ✅ API endpoints referenced in workflow match LocalTesting controller

### Expected Results
1. **OTel Collector**: Should start without configuration errors
2. **Business Flows**: All 7 steps should execute successfully in CI
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Workflow validates both infrastructure and business logic
4. **Better Validation**: Actual functionality testing rather than just container checks

## Lessons Learned & Future Reference
### What Worked Well
- Debugging the exact OTel configuration error from logs led to precise fix
- Using existing LocalTesting API endpoints for business flow testing
- Building comprehensive workflow that tests real functionality
- Proper error handling and reporting in PowerShell workflow steps

### What Could Be Improved  
- Could add more detailed performance metrics collection
- Could implement parallel testing of different business flows
- Could add automated performance regression detection

### Key Insights for Similar Tasks
- Always debug container failures with detailed log analysis first
- Infrastructure testing should include business functionality validation
- Use existing APIs rather than creating new test infrastructure
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting is crucial for CI workflows

### Specific Problems to Avoid in Future
- Don't just test container startup - test actual business functionality
- Don't ignore configuration validation errors - they usually have specific fixes
- Don't implement incomplete workflows that give false confidence
- Always verify that API endpoints used in testing actually exist

### Reference for Future WIs
- OTel configuration issues: Check service.telemetry.metrics section for invalid keys
- Business flow testing: Use LocalTesting API endpoints for comprehensive validation
- Workflow enhancement: Add proper error handling and detailed reporting
- This pattern can be applied to other Aspire-based testing environments
